This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

##Question 1
Read the dataset ‘game_sales.csv’ into R and assign to a variable called df.
```{r}
# check the working directory
getwd()

df <- read.csv("game_sales.csv", header = TRUE,sep = ",")
df
```
##Question 2
What was the highest number of sales seen in the dataset?
```{r}
max(df$sales)
```
##Question 3
What was the average (mean) critic score?
```{r}
mean(df$critic_score)
```
##Question 4
Which genre has the highest average (mean) sales?
```{r}
#get the value counts for the genre
table(df$genre)
```

```{r}
new_df <- df # Duplicate the data
new_df$genre_mean <- ave(df$sales,df$genre) #Get the mean of the genres and save in a new column
new_df
```

```{r}
max_mean_sales <-max(new_df$genre_mean) #Get the max average
max_mean_sales
```
```{r}
max_genre <- new_df$genre_mean == max_mean_sales
Identify_rows <- new_df[max_genre,]
Identify_rows
```
hence the genre is platform



##Question 5
What’s the average (mean) critic score for games developed by EA?
```{r}
#get the value counts for the developer
table(df$developer)
```
```{r}
df2 <- df # duplicate the dataframe
#filter the rows for games developed by EA
Developed_by_EA <- df2$developer == "EA"
Rows <- df2[Developed_by_EA,]
Rows


```
```{r}
#get the mean critic score
mean(Rows$critic_score)
```
##Question 6
Create a new variable modern, which is equal to ‘yes’ when the year published is greater 
than or equal to 2000, and is equal to ‘no’ when the year published is less than 2000.
```{r}
df3 <- df #Duplicate the dataframe
Above_2000 <- df3$year_of_release >= 2000 # create the vector for year of release tha is greater than 2000

```
```{r}
df3$modern <- Above_2000
df3$modern <- factor(df3$modern, levels = c("TRUE","FALSE"), labels = c("yes","no"))
df3
```

##Question 7
Replace ‘Other’ in publisher and developer with a missing value.
```{r}
df4 <- df #Duplicate the dataframe
table(df4$developer)
```
```{r}
table(df4$publisher)
```
Hence no Entries of "other" in the developer column
```{r}
Published_by_Other <- df4$publisher == "Other"
null_rows <- df4[Published_by_Other,]
null_rows

```
```{r}
df4[df4$publisher == "Other",] <- NA
table(df4$publisher)
```
##Question 8
Find the average (mean) user score for games with a critic score greater than or equal to 
80, and for games with a critic score less than 80. Only include games published in the year 
2000 and later.
```{r}
#I had created a vector for rows where year of release is greater than 2000
df5<- df[Above_2000,]
df5
```
```{r}
average_user_score_high_critic <- mean(df5$user_score[df5$critic_score >= 80])
average_user_score_high_critic
```
```{r}
average_user_score_low_critic <- mean(df5$user_score[df5$critic_score < 80])
average_user_score_low_critic
```
##Question 9
For each rating (E, E10+, T and M), find the most common genre.
```{r}
table(df$rating)
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```
```{r}
# Group the data by rating and calculate the mode (most common genre)
mode_genre_by_rating <- df %>%
  group_by(rating) %>%
  summarize(mode_genre = names(sort(table(genre), decreasing = TRUE)[1]))
  #we calculate the mode (most common genre) using the table function, which counts the frequency of each genre, and then we use sort to sort the table in decreasing     order
# Print the result
print(mode_genre_by_rating)
```
##Question 10
Find the average (mean) critic score in each genre, for genres where we have at least 100 
games. Arrange from highest average critic score to lowest.
```{r}
table(df$genre)
```
```{r}
#sort the value counts
mode_genre <- sort(table(df$genre), decreasing = TRUE)
mode_genre
```

I'll find mean critic score for the following genres
-Sports
-Action
-Racing
-Shooter
-Fighting
-Misc
```{r}
Valid_genre <- mode_genre>= 100
Valid_genre
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)
df7 <- df %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  filter(n() >= 100)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
# Group the data by genre and calculate the mean critic score
mean_critic_by_genre <- df7 %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
   summarize(mean_critic_by_genre = names(sort(mean(df7$critic_score), decreasing = TRUE)[1]))
print(mean_critic_by_genre)
```
