Question 1
Read the dataset ‘game_sales.csv’ into R and assign to a variable called df.
```{r}
# check the working directory
getwd()

df <- read.csv("game_sales.csv", header = TRUE,sep = ",")
df
```
Question 2
What was the highest number of sales seen in the dataset?
```{r}
max(df$sales)
```
Question 3
What was the average (mean) critic score?
```{r}
mean(df$critic_score)
```
Question 4
Which genre has the highest average (mean) sales?
```{r}
#get the value counts for the genre
table(df$genre)
```

```{r}
new_df <- df # Duplicate the data
new_df$genre_mean <- ave(df$sales,df$genre) #Get the mean of the genres and save in a new column
new_df
```

```{r}
max_mean_sales <-max(new_df$genre_mean) #Get the max average
max_mean_sales
```
```{r}
max_genre <- new_df$genre_mean == max_mean_sales
Identify_rows <- new_df[max_genre,]
Identify_rows
```
hence the genre is platform



Question 5
What’s the average (mean) critic score for games developed by EA?
```{r}
#get the value counts for the developer
table(df$developer)
```
```{r}
df2 <- df # duplicate the dataframe
#filter the rows for games developed by EA
Developed_by_EA <- df2$developer == "EA"
Rows <- df2[Developed_by_EA,]
Rows


```
```{r}
#get the mean critic score
mean(Rows$critic_score)
```
Question 6
Create a new variable modern, which is equal to ‘yes’ when the year published is greater 
than or equal to 2000, and is equal to ‘no’ when the year published is less than 2000.
```{r}
df3 <- df #Duplicate the dataframe
Above_2000 <- df3$year_of_release >= 2000 # create the vector for year of release tha is greater than 2000

```
```{r}
df3$modern <- Above_2000
df3$modern <- factor(df3$modern, levels = c("TRUE","FALSE"), labels = c("yes","no"))
df3
```

Question 7
Replace ‘Other’ in publisher and developer with a missing value.
